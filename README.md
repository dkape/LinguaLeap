# LinguaLeap - AI-Powered Reading App

This is a starter project for **LinguaLeap**, an interactive language learning application built with Next.js and Firebase.

LinguaLeap is designed to help children learn to read in both English and German. The platform offers a gamified experience with personalized learning paths, courses, reading levels, and quizzes to make learning fun and engaging for students. Teachers can create and manage student groups, generate custom learning paths using AI, and track student progress.

## Tech Stack

This application is built with a modern tech stack including:
- **Next.js**: The React framework for server-rendered applications.
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe code.
- **Tailwind CSS** & **ShadCN/UI**: For a beautiful and responsive user interface.
- **Genkit (Google's Gemini)**: For AI-powered features like generating learning paths and quizzes.
- **Firebase**: For backend services like Authentication and Firestore (to be implemented).
